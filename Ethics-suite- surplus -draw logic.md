# Surplus Draw Logic

**Surplus is not profitâ€”it is provision.**

Spur Command threads surplus through clause-bound pacing:
- Apprentices receive stipends paced by activation and emotional safety
- Spouse is paid from surplus as cadence guardian
- Trusted stewards are compensated through surplus-safe clauses
- Founder draw is sealed only after cadence, compliance, and legacy terrain are protected

## Principles
- No dilution, no spectacle, no urgency-based extraction
- Surplus is paced, not pulled
- Every draw is documented, clause-bound, and emotionally safe

## Governance
Surplus logic is reviewed quarterly. Draw thresholds are sealed by founder-grade override and steward confirmation. All surplus is reinvested into cadence, healing, and generational activation.
