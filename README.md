# Spur Command Core

**Clause-governed architecture for dignified work, cadence protection, and generational activation.**

This repository contains Spur Command’s public-facing governance logic:
- Ethics Suite (Cadence Guardian doctrine, surplus draw logic)
- Intake Packet Samples (clause hierarchy map, onboarding structure)
- Founder Doctrine (bio, override discipline, apprentice onboarding)

## Purpose
Spur Command is a legacy-grade system built to protect cadence, activate apprentices, and inscribe operational truth into every module.

## License
This repo uses the MIT License. All content is protected by founder-grade governance. No drift, no dilution.
