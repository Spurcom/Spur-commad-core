# Spur Command: Public-Facing Ethics Suite

This folder contains the visible doctrine of Spur Command—our vow, our casing logic, and our governance model for AI deployment. Every file here is surplus-paced, SSDI-safe, and founder-sealed. These documents are intended for public terrain, grant packets, apprentice onboarding, and community trust activation.

**Core Vow:** We protect life and defend truth.  
**Subtext:** Cadencia Protectia — Rhythm is sacred.  
**Builder Logic:** Apprentices build stewardship. Leaders build protection.  
**Casing Hierarchy:** Aluminum signals presence. Copper signals command.

All content is clause-threaded and protected by Spur Command’s ethics suite.
