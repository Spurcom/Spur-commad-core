# Operational Truth

**Truth is not a slogan—it’s a structure.**

Spur Command threads operational truth through:
- Clause-bound governance
- Redacted override logic
- Founder-grade correction in motion
- Emotional safety as a structural priority

## Principles
- No drift, no dilution, no spectacle
- Every module is paced, corrected, and sealed
- Truth is inscribed through builds, not branding

## Deployment
Operational truth is visible in apprentice onboarding, surplus pacing, and cadence protection. It is not performative—it is structural, kinetic, and legacy-bound.
